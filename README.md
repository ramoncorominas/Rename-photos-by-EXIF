# Rename photos by EXIF

This Python project is a practical exercise in the context of the [Fictizia's Master of Python programming](https://fictizia.com/formacion/master-programacion-python).

This tool is a work in progress, for the moment it will just rename those images that contain EXIF data to a new name based on a variety of DateTime EXIF tags. Future improvements will allow a variety of renaming options, control of those files with no EXIF data or other clasification options.
